    <h1>New Mirror: One Year in Review</h1>
    <h3>Written by Benjamin Lannon on May 30th, 2017</h3>
    <p>
        It's been a little over 1 year since the newest iteration of our FOSS Mirror was built. as the service
        has been running since 2002, it is one of the oldest services in the labs, but it is also one of the most
        outfacing. 
    </p>
    <p>
        For some high level statistics, the service started out with 13 distributions of Linux and 5 other software
        packages back when it launched in April 2016. as the year went on, we have grown our hosting presence to now 18 linux distros, 2 BSD releases,
        and 12 misc. software packages. as well, the usage of Mirror has grown tremendously over the year. Starting
        early last May, we started collecting statistics on the bandwidth usage of Mirror which can be found on the
        statistics page, and by the 1 year mark, we were able to reach over 370TB of total bandwidth. On April 6, 2017,
        due to the release of CentOS 6.9, we had a continuous usage of over 700mbps outbound in the early morning,
        which at some times was capped due to our network limits within the labs. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Other than the occasional network issues or kernel upgrade, the server has remained online and functional.
        This past summer, to reduce congestion on inbound syncing, Bobby Newman and myself developed a schedule
        for all of the various packages and distros to be synced throughout the day. It can be found at
        <a href="http://docs.cslabs.clarkson.edu/wiki/Mirror_Schedule">Mirror Schedule</a> on Docs.
    </p>
    <p>
        As we enter the 2017-2018 school year, we likely will continue to add new packages or distros as well as work on
        getting more currently hosted distros to become official mirrors. One year later, I would like to thank Eric Busse,
        Ted Champagne, Steve Evanchik, Wenjin Hu, and Mark Platek for their generous help to make the 3rd iteration of
        our mirror possible.
