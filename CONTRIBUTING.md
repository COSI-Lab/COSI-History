# Contribution Guide

If you have found something you want to contribute to the website, head over to
the issues tab and check if there is an issue on it already. If there is, write
a comment asking how you could help out with it. If there isn't an issue for the
topic, feel free to add one.

Next, fork the repository into your own account and make the changes. Once you are
done, make a Pull Request and wait for myself or someone else with write access to
the main repo to check it over and likely accept it.
